Steven
    - redstone performance at different core counts
    - pick what worlds to benchmark around
        - for each benchmark world
            - redstone component count for each type [Henry]
            - how many wires are there? [redstone block vs group of redstone block]
            - statistics about circuit connectivity (tree depth is great, maybe one more thing?)
    - stress_test benchmark needs to be fixed to no longer have spurious redstone blocks that connect nothing
    - transposing world to see if theres a perf difference
    - want data for rebuild
    - want data for tick
        - tick has 2 steps we want separate data for
            - equation solve step (wavefront)
            - blit step
            - mention the two other small steps [update delay ticks]

Henry
    - add performance counters for
        - number of rays cast
        - number of texture lookups
    - data transfer between host and device (instanced rendering)
        - might have to bring back pre-instanced rendering code
        - 36x less data transfer
        - before stevens computer would get crashed
    - comparing naive to predicated
    - comparing mipmap to predicated
        - how does less branch coherence tradeoff with fewer texture lookups at different world sizes
    - ray bounce direction effect on performance
    - face culling anomaly
    - the fact that the gshader pass dominates performance on large worlds

    - would be nice if redstone ran on its own thread
